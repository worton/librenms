```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms-agent/master/snmp/apache-stats.py -O /etc/snmp/apache-stats.py
```
2. Make the script executable (chmod +x /etc/snmp/apache-stats.py)
3. Verify it is working by running /etc/snmp/apache-stats.py
(In some cases urlgrabber needs to be installed, in Debian it can be achieved by: apt-get install python-urlgrabber)
4. Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf) and add:
```
extend apache /etc/snmp/apache-stats.py
```
5. Restart snmpd on your host

##### Agent
[Install the agent](#agent-setup) on this device if it isn't already and copy the `apache` script to `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/`

1. Verify it is working by running /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/apache
(If you get error like "Can't locate LWP/Simple.pm". libwww-perl needs to be installed: apt-get install libwww-perl)
2. On the device page in Librenms, edit your host and check the `Apache` under the Applications tab.


### BIND9 aka named
##### Agent
[Install the agent](#agent-setup) on this device if it isn't already and copy the `bind` script to `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/`

Create stats file with appropriate permissions:
```shell

Change `user:group` to the user and group that's running bind/named.

Bind/named configuration:
```text
options {
	...
	statistics-file "/etc/bind/named.stats";
	zone-statistics yes;
	...
};
```
Restart your bind9/named after changing the configuration.

Verify that everything works by executing `rndc stats && cat /etc/bind/named.stats`.
In case you get a `Permission Denied` error, make sure you chown'ed correctly.

Note: if you change the path you will need to change the path in `scripts/agent-local/bind`.

3. Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`) and add:
`extend proxmox /usr/local/bin/proxmox`
(Note: if your snmpd doesn't run as root, you might have to invoke the script using sudo. `extend proxmox /usr/bin/sudo /usr/local/bin/proxmox`)
4. Restart snmpd on your host
5. On the device page in Librenms, edit your host and check `Proxmox` on the Applications tab.

snmp ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /etc/snmp/raspberry.sh, /usr/bin/vcgencmd*
```
5. Restart snmpd on PI host



### TinyDNS aka  djbdns

##### Agent
[Install the agent](#agent-setup) on this device if it isn't already and copy the `tinydns` script to `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/`

_Note_: We assume that you use DJB's [Daemontools](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html) to start/stop tinydns.
And that your tinydns instance is located in `/service/dns`, adjust this path if necessary.

1. Replace your _log_'s `run` file, typically located in `/service/dns/log/run` with:
```shell
#!/bin/sh
exec setuidgid dnslog tinystats ./main/tinystats/ multilog t n3 s250000 ./main/
```
2. Create tinystats directory and chown:
```shell
mkdir /service/dns/log/main/tinystats
chown dnslog:nofiles /service/dns/log/main/tinystats
```
3. Restart TinyDNS and Daemontools: `/etc/init.d/svscan restart`
   _Note_: Some say `svc -t /service/dns` is enough, on my install (Gentoo) it doesn't rehook the logging and I'm forced to restart it entirely.

Agent Setup
-----------

To gather data from remote systems you can use LibreNMS in combination with check_mk (found [here](https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent)).

Make sure that systemd or xinetd is installed on the host you want to run the agent on.

The agent uses TCP-Port 6556, please allow access from the **LibreNMS host** and **poller nodes** if you're using the [Distributed Polling](http://docs.librenms.org/Extensions/Distributed-Poller/) setup.

On each of the hosts you would like to use the agent on then you need to do the following:

1. Clone the `librenms-agent` repository:

```shell
cd /opt/
git clone https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent.git
cd librenms-agent
```

2. Copy the relevant check_mk_agent to `/usr/bin`:

| linux | freebsd |
| --- | --- |
| `cp check_mk_agent /usr/bin/check_mk_agent` | `cp check_mk_agent_freebsd /usr/bin/check_mk_agent` |

```shell
chmod +x /usr/bin/check_mk_agent
```

3. Copy the service file(s) into place.

| xinetd | systemd |
| --- | --- |
| `cp check_mk_xinetd /etc/xinetd.d/check_mk` | `cp check_mk@.service check_mk.socket /etc/systemd/system` |

4. Create the relevant directories.

```shell
mkdir -p /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local
```

5. Copy each of the scripts from `agent-local/` into `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local` that you require to be graphed.  You can find detail setup instructions for specific applications above.
6. Make each one executable that you want to use with `chmod +x /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/$script`
7. Enable the check_mk service

| xinetd | systemd |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc/init.d/xinetd restart` | `systemctl enable check_mk.socket && systemctl start check_mk.socket` |

8. Login to the LibreNMS web interface and edit the device you want to monitor. Under the modules section, ensure that unix-agent is enabled.
9. Then under Applications, enable the apps that you plan to monitor.
10. Wait for around 10 minutes and you should start seeing data in your graphs under Apps for the device.
